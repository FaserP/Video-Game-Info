Installation
------------
In Linux to install this system, you must make sure your system has a command line that has access to c++. In my example I have used Terminal command line. The system must also have SQLite3 install.

1. First you must type in the command line "make install"
   - This will create a database and a bin folder.

2. You must then type in the command line ./bin/server -p <port number>
   - In my example I have used the port number 8080

3. You must thne type in the command line ./bin/client -p <port number>
   - Again I typed the port number 8080

4. Finally you will have access to the GUI in the client command line. Instruction will be on the screen on how to use the system.
